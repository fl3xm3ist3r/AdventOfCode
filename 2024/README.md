# Advent of Code 2024 in C#

The project is based on [AoCHelper](https://github.com/eduherminio/AoCHelper) to simplify the execution and having a helpful output.
You can either run the project with:

-   `dotnet run` to run only the newest available day
-   `dotnet run <day>` to run a specific day
-   `dotnet run all` to run all days
